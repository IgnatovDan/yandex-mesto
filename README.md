# The "MeCTO" project

https://ignatovdan.github.io/yandex-p4-mesto-my/ - you can take a look at the project right now!

You will see several places with photos and descriptions.
Also, you will see photo/name/details of the page owner and can change them (click the 'edit' button).

The page is optimized for viewing on desktop (>1024) and on mobile (<1024) devices: layout changes depending on the width of your device/browser.
