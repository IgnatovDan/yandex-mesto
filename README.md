# The "MeCTO" project

https://ignatovdan.github.io/yandex-mesto/ - you can take a look at the project right now!

There are several places with photos and descriptions, photo/name/details of the page owner, popups to change values and add new places.

The page is optimized for viewing on desktop (>1024) and on mobile (<1024) devices: layout changes depending on the width of your device/browser.
